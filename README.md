Remote Developer Manifesto
===

##Intro

We created this manifesto to explain the motives and views of developers that choose to work remotely. It is a guideline for both developers and companies on what to expect.

##Manifesto

We believe in giving people the freedom to choose where they are going to work from.

Technology has already evolved to a point where we can choose where we are going to work from and don’t need to be together the whole time. (C’mon, give us some space!)

In case we live or find ourselves near a company's office, we expect to be able to work from there whenever we want to, but we don’t need to go there every day to get work done. (Commuting daily to an office is so 90’s…)

We want to have opportunities to meet the people we are working with.

We don’t think better life quality is met in a cubicle. 

Life/work balance is important to us, so let us dedicate time to our families and doing things we love instead of taking long commutes to work. 

We believe in being able to work during our most productive hours, from places that inspire and relax us. 

We want to meet new places and new people instead of being bound to a single location. 

We work flexible hours. But we also understand that there may be a set of hours we need to work to sync with the rest of a team, or because of other meetings.

That is what motivates us, what matters to us. That is the life quality we have always dreamed of for ourselves, and that is what we achieve when working remotely.
